Tree Clustering Library (R package)
===================================

RTC performs cluster analysis using trees. A tree approximates
the probability density function from which data has been drawn.
A set of such trees is inferred using a Metropolis-Hastings sampler,
and returned as a partitioning of the parameter space into rectangular segments.

This package uses the [libtc](https://bitbucket.org/pkuma/libtc) library.
